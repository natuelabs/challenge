## Challenge for Backend Developer

A customer needs to search in our product catalog (available in this <a href="https://github.com/natuelabs/challenge/blob/master/products.json">JSON</a>) and he wants to find products that match your food restrictions.
Based on this you will need to develop:

- a simple API to search products in the .json available;
- it should be possible to search for products by their specifications (one or more);
- it must be possible to order the result by price (asc and desc);

The test should be done in PHP. We expect at the end of the test, outside the API running, the following items:

- an explanation of what is needed to make your project work;
- an explanation of how to perform the tests;

Remember that at the time of the evaluation we will look at:

- Code organization;
- Object-Oriented Principles;
- Maintenance;

To send us your code, you must:

Make a fork of this repository, and send us a pull-request.
